# Hamming Distance

This project makes simple use of file reading and string manipulations in rust. The code calculate the [Hamming Distance](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dist%C3%A2ncia_de_Hamming) between two strings of the same length. I created a file that contains example of multiple pairs of DNA strands for comparison.

## Features

- File reading
- String manipulation

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, run the following commands to clone the project and run the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/renatoalvesjr/rustfication.git
cd rustfication/hamming
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Usage

You can edit the `hamming_tests.txt` file to change the program's output.

- Each line of the file must contain two strings of the same length.
- The file must not end with an empty line.
