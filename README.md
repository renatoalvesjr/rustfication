# Rustfication

 This repository is a collection of various Rust learning projects. It serves as a documentation of my learning curve in Rust. Each project is designed to provide hands-on experience and deepen understanding of different aspects of the Rust programming language.

## Projects

1. **Type Calculator** - Use type conversion to manipulate integers and perform simple arithmetic calculations.
2. **Factorial** - A simple factorial function using recursive functions.
3. **Ticket Manager** - A JIRA-like ticket manager... **W.I.P**.

## Getting Started

 To get started with any of the projects, clone the repository and follow the instructions in each project's README file.

**Happy coding!**
