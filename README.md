# Rustfication

This repository is a collection of various Rust learning projects. It serves as documentation of my learning curve in Rust. Each project is designed to provide hands-on experience and deepen understanding of different aspects of the Rust programming language.

## Projects

1. **Type Calculator** - Uses type conversion to manipulate integers and perform simple arithmetic calculations.
2. **Factorial** - Implements a simple factorial function using recursion.
3. **Ticket Manager** - A JIRA-like ticket manager that utilizes enums and structs, capable of performing simple CRUD operations.
4. **Hamming Distance** - Calculates the Hamming Distance between two strings of the same length using file reading and string manipulation.

## Getting Started

To follow along with my learning journey, clone the repository and follow the instructions in each project's README file. Ensure you have Git and Rust properly installed on your machine.

**Happy coding!**
